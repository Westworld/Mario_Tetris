Super Mario World on the SNES was probably one of the games my brother and I played the most in our lives. So the emotional connection with the plumbers starts there. The first games of the franchise, still on the NES, were revolutionary and represented a great relief for the gaming industry that was going through a bad phase in the first half of the 80's. This article guides you to create an animated Mario clock that can be a retro decorative object for any environment.
